# Data for the six nonlinear time series from the east of the Netherlands

This dataset contains the data from Waterschap Rijn en IJssel. The meteorological data is obtained from the [KNMI](https://www.knmi.nl/nederland-nu/klimatologie-metingen-en-waarnemingen). We want to thank Waterschap Rijn en IJssel for making the data publicly available.

The time series are nonlinear in the sense that the behavior is very different in the summer and winter. The winter shows highly variable and spiky behavior, while in summer the system is much smoother. This makes these time series a good challenge for the nonlinear recharge models implemented in Pastas. An example for the nonlinear recharge models is given in the Nonlinear_Time_Series.ipynb
