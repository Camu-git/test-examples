# Data From van der Spek and Bakker (2017)

This dataset contains the data used in [The influence of the length of the calibration period and observation frequency on predictive uncertainty in time series modeling of groundwater dynamics](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/share/XCUXCQGWFNHFZMKRFTVU?target=10.1002/2016WR019704) - Joanne van der Spek and Mark Bakker (2017). The head measurements are obtained from [DINOloket](https://www.dinoloket.nl/) and the meteorological data obtained from the [KNMI](https://www.knmi.nl/nederland-nu/klimatologie-metingen-en-waarnemingen). The supporting information [Table S1](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/downloadSupplement?doi=10.1002%2F2016WR019704&file=wrcr22532-sup-0001-2016WR019704-s01.pdf) is followed to obtain the time series for the right measurement locations and filter depths. For the precipitation time series the weather station time series are preferred to the rain station time series if available.

Visualizations are available for the full duration of the eighteen head time series. For a map of the head measurement locations we refer to [Figure 7](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/7b77ff2a-3636-461c-8c93-1aaf1149bab6/wrcr22532-fig-0007-m.jpg) in van der Spek and Bakker (2017).
